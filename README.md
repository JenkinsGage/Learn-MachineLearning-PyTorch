# Machine Learning - PyTorch
This repo contains many notebooks created by me while learning machine learning. I have used many libraries like pytorch, transformers ... to finish many tasks in machine learning from scratch. Some of them are well commented in English.

## NLP
- [Transformer Based Translation](./NLP/Translation/TransformerBasedTranslation.IPYNB)<br>
I have used the transformer module in pytorch to build a model for translation from Chinese to English where the Chinese is tokenized by jieba and the English is tokenized by basic English tokenizer from torchtext. And the model is trained on wmt19 dataset from huggenface.
- [Paraphrase Inference From Huggingface Pretrained Model](./NLP/Paraphrases/InferenceFromTransformers.IPYNB)<br>
Here I used a model from huggingface to paraphrase sentences 
- [Paraphrase Gradio App](./NLP/Paraphrases/GradioApp.py)<br>
Here I used gradio to build a webui for interacting with the paraphrase model
